## About me

Hi, I'm Tom Wieland.

I am a Senior Full Stack Developer with a decade's worth of experience on projects; architecting, designing, building, and delivering highly available and scalable full-stack solutions - improving current products/processes, adding new features, and building new products. I build websites, apps, platforms, interfaces and dashboards for different devices and networked services to handle traffic at scale; directing deliverables through all aspects of the software development lifecycle. I am an active opensource developer; exploring opportunities in Machine Learning and an avid learner of new tech stack and industry best practices.
