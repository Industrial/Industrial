## Donations

I'm having a pretty rough time surviving right now. I don't have a job and I'm running out of time. If you would like to make a donation, which I will use for :bread: :kiwi_fruit: :milk_glass:, you can do so via **Donorbox** or **Bitcoin**. Thank you very much :heart:.

If you make a donation and leave a message with **any** charity of your choice, I will list your name here and donate 2x your amount to that charity before the end of 2020! If you want to stay anonymous, that's fine.
